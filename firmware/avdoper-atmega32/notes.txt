here works HVPP and HVSP

[x] find only what the F***K enables JTAG
    on this MCU. The disabling in main is not sufficient
[x] fusereset doesn't work for hvsp,
    read signature gives 0xff, despite set or clr weak pull up SDO
[ ] sometimes there's protocolr error: (dmesg shows no usb error)
Writing |                                                    | 0% 0.00sError
sending message: error sending control message: Protocol error

[ ] consecutevely reading low/high fuse on atmega162, atmega8
    sometimes returns 0xff
    -> bringing up and down progmode causes this
    delays in leaveprogmode helped for m8
    still if there's delay after leving progmode, m8 gives errors
