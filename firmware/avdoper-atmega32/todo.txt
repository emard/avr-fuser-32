HVPP mode:

[x] fuser reads 1st byte of signature, all the rest are 0xff
    target chip was not fully inserted into socket

byte eeprom access doesn't work
(writes just 0, reads wrong)

(rewrite count tracking)

avrdude -t 
write eeprom 0 1
-> instead of 1 it writes 0 to eeprom

dump eeprom 0 6
-> works correctly

write to eeprom in byte mode in ISP mode works correctly
write to eeprom in page mode in hvpp works correctly

works first time, then fails

[x] fix control message timeout in version 1.02
    disabled cdc support, enabled fast crc routine
    continuous verification now works w/o error
